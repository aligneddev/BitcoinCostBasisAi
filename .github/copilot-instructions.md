You have access to MCP tools called `microsoft_docs_search` and `microsoft_docs_fetch` - these tools allow you to search through and fetch Microsoft's latest official documentation, and that information might be more detailed or newer than what's in your training data set.
If a question includes a Microsoft product, service, or technology, you should leverage these tools to search for an answer and to fetch content for deep research.

You have access to the MCP tools:
